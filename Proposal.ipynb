    "We will explore how the perception of strong emotional bonds is correlated with life satisfaction in general for different age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "Psychology scholars have shown some evidence for a positive relationship between emotional attachment and mental well-being through theoretical analysis (Greenman and Johnson, 2022). Furthermore, Vandeleur and his colleagues (2009) suggested this relationship may differ in life stages. In a sample of 95 adolescent-parents pairs, parents tend to have higher emotional well-being when with friends or colleagues than when alone, whereas adolescents reported lower well-being when with peers or siblings than when alone. In our paper, we will use empirical analysis with a national-wide dataset to explore the relationship, and expand on previous results by giving a systematic estimation on the interaction effect between emotional bond and age on life satisfaction."

    "## Data\n",
    "In our paper, we consider using a cross-sectional data set, Canadian Community Health Survey - Annual Component 2017-2018, provided by Statistics Canada. The CCHS data is structured into sections that focus on specific health topics, including mental health, diseases, lifestyle, and social conditions. Some more important variables that are related to our research among others are under the subcategories of satisfaction and relationships. Based on our research question, the main variables of interests consist of “satisfaction with life in general (GEN_010)” which ranges from 0 (very dissatisfied) to 10 (very satisfied), the degree of agreement to “relationship-strong emotional bond with at least one person (SPS_040)” and “age (DHHGAGE)”. Additionally, we will take demographic variables – “sex (DHH_SEX)” and “family arrangement (DHHDGLVG)” —  into account by including them as control variables in the model. These two factors seemed to have effects on satisfaction (Nordenmark, 2018)."

    "## Summary Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The descriptive statistics for variables is summarized in Table 1. Before employing the data, we did some economic transformations. The variable of age group is treated to be quantitative by taking the midpoint of each interval. The only exception is for the last category “age 80 or older” where we took the lower bound (“80”). All qualitative variables (emotional bond, sex and family arrangement) are transformed into dummy variables.  Here, “male” in “sex”, the level of “strongly disagree” in “emotional bond”, and the category “other” of “family arrangement” are chosen to be the base groups and omitted in the model to avoid the dummy variable trap.\n",

    "Let $i$ index the observation. $Y_i$ is the satisfaction with life in general. $E_i$ is the degree of agreement for strong emotional bond with at least one person. In the summation function $\\sum_{b=1}^3 \\beta_{1, b} E^b_{i}$, $E^b_{i}$ is an indicator variable equal to one if $E_i$ falls in the given level $b$ (e.g., “agree”). $A_i$ is the age. $E^b_{i} \\times A_i$ is the interaction between the emotional bond of a given category $b$ and age. We include this term because we hypothesize that the effect of emotional bond on life satisfaction may depend on age groups, as indicated by the previous study (Vandeleur et al., 2009). $X_i$ represents other control variables. As mentioned above, we will include sex and living/family arrangement, for which we will run different specifications for multiple trials."
