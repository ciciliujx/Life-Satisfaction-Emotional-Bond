    "# Preliminary Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this preliminary analysis, I used a linear regression model to explore whether sexuality has an effect on life satisfaction. Specifically, I estimated the model $Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 S_i + \\alpha X_i + \\epsilon_i$, where $Y_i$ is \"satisfaction with life in general\" and $S_i$ is \"sex\"* in the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) data. I also included \"emotional bond with more than 1 person\" denoted by $X_i$ as the control variable in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first stage, I set $\\alpha = 0$, using a simple regression model to see if there is a relationship between sex and life satisfaction without controlling the other variable. In the next stage, I included $X_i$ into the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical result suggested that sex may not have an effect on the life satisfaction, while the emotional bond seems to have a noticeable effect on the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It may be preferred to use \"gender\" as the variable in interest, but the CCHS data set does not provide such.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Features\n",
    "- The variable \"satisfaction with life in general\" is quantitative and ranges from 0 (Very dissatisfied) to 10 (Very satisfied). \n",
    "- The variable \"sex\" is a dummy variable.\n",
    "- \"Emotional bond with more than 1 person\" is on likert scale and includes 4 levels - strongly disagree, disagree, agree and strongly agree.\n",

    "While we control for another variable such as the \"emotional bond,\" the coefficient measures the pure effect (relative to the without-control case) of sex on satisfaction with life. The statistical test (p-value > 0.05) suggests a difference of life satisfaction level in means may not exist by sexual groups.\n",

This suggests a promising relationship between emotional bond and life satisfaction, which we will focus more on in the final project."
